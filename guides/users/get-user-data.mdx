title: Get User Data
description: Each project presents unique requirements for user onboarding. In this guide you'll learn to get user data from Hanko.
---

<Info>
**It's good to remember that the user ID is the immmutable identifier**

<Accordion title="But what is an immutable identifier? ðŸ¤”">
    In the context of user data, an "immutable identifier" refers to a piece of information that remains constant and cannot be changed once it's assigned to a user. In this case, the `user id` is the immutable identifier. It's a unique value assigned to each user and it doesn't change even if other user details (like email, username, etc.) are modified.
</Accordion>

The primary email address can be changed, therefore when handling user registration, the user `id` should be used to
determine if it's a known user.
</Info>

## Getting user data on the Frontend

If you only need the user data for a frontend usage, you can use the `Hanko.user.getCurrent()` function from the
[hanko-frontend-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk) (it is also re-exported from
[hanko-elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-elements)):

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nextjs (App directory)">
```js
"use client";

import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-elements";

const hankoApi = <YOUR_HANKO_API_URL>;
const hanko = new Hanko(hankoApi);

const {id, email} = await hanko.user.getCurrent();
console.log(`user-id: ${id}, email: ${email}`);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>



<Info>
Please keep in mind that if you create a function to get the
user data, you will be fetching data from the API again every
time you call the function. We advise you to make sure the function
is only called once for every user authentication.
</Info>

## Getting user data on the Backend

### Getting user ID from the JWT

The Hanko API sends back a cookie upon successful authentication, which is then sent to the RP backend for each subsequent
request. The cookie contains a JWT. One of the things we can get from this JWT is the user ID. We can use the [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose) library
to decode the value of such a JWT:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nextjs (App directory)">
```js
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import * as jose from "jose";

export async function userId() {
  const token = cookies().get("hanko")?.value;
  const payload = jose.decodeJwt(token ?? "");

  const userID = payload.sub;
  return userID;
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Get user data using the Hanko Admin API

The [Hanko Admin API](/api-reference/admin) provides detailed information about the status, user management, metrics and more. In this example we will focus on
getting the data from a specific user.
To get data for a specific user, call the `/users/{id}` endpoint of the Hanko Admin API, where `id` is the user id previously obtained from the JWT.

<Info>
On Hanko Cloud the Hanko Admin API is a paid feature and must be enabled separately.
You also need an API key `secret` to access the Hanko Admin API. You can generate one under the `Settings/API Keys` section of your project.
Keep in mind, that the API key `secret` is only showed once, so make sure to store it in a safe place, like an environmental variable as shown in the following example.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nextjs (App directory)">
```js
const getUserData = async () => {
  const adminAPI = process.env.ADMIN_API;
  const adminSecret = process.env.ADMIN_SECRET;
  const options = {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${adminSecret}`,
    },
  };

  const response = await fetch(`${adminAPI}/users/${userID}`, options);

  return response.json();
};

const userData = await getUserData();
console.log("user data:", userData);
```
