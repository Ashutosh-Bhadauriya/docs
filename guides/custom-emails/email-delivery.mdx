This guide will walk you through the process of sending your own emails instead of relying on Hanko's default email delivery.

## Create a Webhook

Create a webhook with the event `email.send`. This webhook will be triggered whenever an email needs to be sent.

<Note>
  If you have not created a webhook yet, please refer to the
  [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) guide.
</Note>

## Disable Email delivery by Hanko

<ProFeatureNote/>

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Access your project's email delivery settings"}>
        Log in to Hanko Cloud, select your organization and project and navigate to `Settings > Email delivery`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Disable Email delivery"}>
        Find the `Email delivery by Hanko` setting and click the toggle to disable it.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Once disabled, Hanko will no longer send any emails on your behalf.

## Send your own emails

When an email needs to be sent, the `email.send` webhook event will be triggered, providing you with all the necessary
data to send your own email. The webhook token payload will include the following information:

import WebhookEmailSendExample from '/snippets/webhooks/email-send-example.mdx';
import WebhookEmailSendProperties from '/snippets/webhooks/email-send-properties.mdx';

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title={"'email.send' token payload example"} defaultOpen={true}>
        <WebhookEmailSendExample/>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title={"'email.send' token payload properties"}>
        <WebhookEmailSendProperties/>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The `data` property in the token payload provides type-specific data that can be used to personalize
the email further. The structure of the `data` property varies depending on the `type`
of the email being sent.

Using the provided webhook data, you can compose and send the email to the user using your preferred email service
provider or custom email infrastructure.
