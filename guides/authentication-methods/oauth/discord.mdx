In this guide you will learn how to add a login with Discord to your application.

## Prerequisites

1. You need a Hanko Cloud account and a project. Learn more on how to set them up [here](https://docs.hanko.io/setup-hanko-cloud).
2. You need a Discord account. You can create account [here](https://discord.com/register).

## Get your provider redirect URL

When creating an Discord application, you need to provide a redirect URL that determines where the third party
provider redirects after a successful login. This redirect URL consists of the base URL of the Hanko API
and the [`/thirdparty/callback`](http://docs.hanko.io/api/public#tag/Third-Party/operation/thirdPartyCallback) endpoint. You can always view your redirect URL in the Hanko Cloud Console:

1. Sign in to [cloud.hanko.io](https://cloud.hanko.io).
2. Select your `Organization`.
3. Select your `Project`.
4. In the left sidebar, click `Settings`, then select `Identity providers`.
5. Find your redirect URL in the `Redirect URL` input.

        alt="Hanko Callback URL"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

You need the redirect URL for [creating a new Discord application](#create-a-new-discord-application) in the next step and when
[configuring your credentials with Hanko](#configure-credentials-with-hanko) (you will also configure the remaining
configuration options visible in the above screen in this step).

## Create a new Discord application

1. Navigate to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. On the main dashboard, select `Applications` in the left sidebar.
3. On the top right, select `New Application`.

        alt="Create a new discor application"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

4. Provide a name for your application, agree to the Discord terms of service and click `Create`

    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/discord/new-application-modal.png"
        alt="New application registration modal"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

5. On your application dashboard, select `OAuth2` in the left sidebar.
6. In the `Redirects` panel, click `Add Redirect`.


<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/discord/add-redirect.png"
        alt="Add redirect URL"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

7. Enter the `Redirect URL` you obtained in the [previous step](#get-your-provider-redirect-url) in the input that
appears.
8. Click `Save changes`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/discord/enter-redirect-url.png"
        alt="Enter redirect URL"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

## Get your client ID and secret

1. In the `OAuth2` settings of your application, copy the `Client ID`.
2. Click `Reset Secret`, follow the prompts to generate a new secret, then copy the generated secret.

        width={500}
    />
</Frame>


## Configure credentials with Hanko

1. In the Hanko Cloud Console, navigate to your project `Settings` and select `Identity providers`.
2. Configure the following:

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/hanko-callback-url.png"

        width={500}
    />

      - **Error Redirect URL**: This is the URL target in your frontend the Hanko API redirects to if an error occurs during third
    party sign-in. If your frontend [uses the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), this URL should be the URL of the
    page that embeds the web component such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
      - **Allowed Redirect URL**: This is the URL target in your frontend the Hanko API is allowed to redirect to after third party
    authentication was successful. If your frontend [uses the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), this URL should be
    the URL of the page that embeds the web component.

        <Note>
        The allowed redirect URL supports wildcard matching through globbing:
         - `https://*.example.com` matches `https://foo.example.com` and `https://bar.example.com`.
         - `https://foo.example.com/*` matches URLs like `https://foo.example.com/page1` and `https://foo.example.com/page2`.
         -  Use ** to act as a super-wildcard/match-all.
        </Note>

2. In the `Providers` section, select `Discord` and use the `Enable provider` toggle to enable the provider.
3. Provide the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you obtained in one of the [previous section](#get-your-client-id-and-secret)
in the remaining inputs.
4. Click `Save`.

## Frontend integration

To enable a login with Discord in your frontend application we recommend using either our pre-built UI as
provided by the [`@teamhanko/hanko-elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-elements) package or building a custom UI using
the [`@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk).

<Tabs>

    <Tab title="Hanko Elements">
        We recommend following one of our [quickstart guides](https://docs.hanko.io/quickstarts) to integrate
        the `<hanko-auth>` component from our `@teamhanko/hanko-elements` package in your frontend application .
        On successful integration, the component will display a button for signing in with `Discord` in the login view
        of the component.

        <Note>
            Make sure to configure the page the web component is embedded on as your `error redirect URL` as well as an
            `allowed redirect URL` (see the [previous step](#configure-credentials-with-hanko)).
        </Note>

        On successful authentication with the provider, the backend issues a session cookie and the web component
        continues the usual component flow on success. Errors that occur during third party
        provider authentication are also picked up and displayed in the web component accordingly.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Hanko Frontend SDK">
        When building your own UI, you can use the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` to initialize third party sign in.
        Create a [`Hanko` client](https://teamhanko.github.io/hanko/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/Client.html) instance and call  the
        `thirdParty.auth` method with `discord` as your provider and the target URL in your app you want to redirect
        to after authentication.

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        // you can find the Hanko API URL on the dashboard of your project
        // in the Hanko Cloud Console
        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

        async function signInWithDiscord() {
          try {
            // the redirect url argument must be one of the allowed redirect URLs
            // configured in the previous step.
            await hanko.thirdParty.auth("discord", "<your_redirect_url>");
          } catch (error) {
            // handle error
          }
        }
        ```

        On successful authentication, the API redirects you to the given redirect URL. The URL query includes a one time
        token that must be exchanged for a JWT. Use the `token.validate` method on your client to validate the token:

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        // you can find the Hanko API URL on the dashboard of your project
        // in the Hanko Cloud Console
        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

            async function onLoad() {
              try {
                await hanko.token.validate();
              } catch (error) {
                // handle error
              }
                // you should now have a JWT cookie set
            }
            ```

            On success, the API issues a JWT which is then set by the SDK as a cookie (hanko). All other SDK methods
            can now use the cookie to make authenticated requests to the API.
