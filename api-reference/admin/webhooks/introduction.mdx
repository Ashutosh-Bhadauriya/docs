## Events
Webhooks are an easy way to get informed about changes in your Hanko instance (e.g. user or email updates).
Hanko provides the following event structure:

| Event                     | Triggers on                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user                      | user creation, user deletion, user update, email creation, email deletion, change of primary email |
| user.create               | user creation                                                                                      |
| user.delete               | user deletion                                                                                      |
| user.update               | user update, email creation, email deletion, change of primary email                               |
| user.update.email         | email creation, email deletion, change of primary email                                            |
| user.update.email.create  | email creation                                                                                     |
| user.update.email.delete  | email deletion                                                                                     |
| user.update.email.primary | change of primary email                                                                            |

As you can see, events can have subevents. You are able to filter which events you want to receive by either selecting
a parent event when you want to receive all subevents or selecting specific subevents.

## Restrictions

Due to security concerns there are some usage restrictions for webhooks in place:

* A webhook will be disabled after 30 days without usage. In this scenario usage describes the successful triggering of events
* A webhook will also be disabled when our trigger mechanism is not successful. The mechanism will try 5 attempts of sending events before disabling a webhook. A trigger is unsuccessful when:
  * your callback URL is not reachable due to network errors or a wrong url
  * your webhook endpoint returns HTTP Status codes >= 400

The restrictions are not available for webhooks defined in the config file.

## Data

When a webhook is triggered it will send you a **JSON** body which contains the event and a jwt.
The JWT contains 2 custom claims:
* **data**: contains the whole object for which the change was made. (e.g.: the whole user object when an email or user is changed/created/deleted)
* **evt**: the event for which the webhook was triggered
